                Hi! I go by Natalie and use she/her pronouns.<br>
                <br>
                I advocate for equality and freedom for all marginalised people of the world.
                Open-source software is also core to my beliefs of privacy and freedom.<br>
                <br>
                My main programming projects use C, C++, x86 AT&T Assembly, Python and Java, amongst other languages which I have personal experience in.
                Alongside systems and applications programming, I spend an amount of my time on Linux system administration and minor web development.<br>
                <br>
                See <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> or feel free to browse my <a href="https://github.com/adora0">GitHub</a> to see some of my work.
                I have personal experience in low-level x86 programming and an interest in providing high-level backend and frontend programming to socialist NGOs in the future.
