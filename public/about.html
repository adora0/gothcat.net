                Hi! I go by Natalie and use she/her pronouns.<br>
                <br>
                I advocate for equality and freedom for all marginalised people
                of the world. Open-source software is also core to my beliefs of
                privacy and freedom.<br>
                <br>
                My main programming projects use C, C++, x86 AT&T Assembly,
                TypeScript, and Python, amongst other languages in which I have
                personal experience.
                Alongside systems and applications programming, I spend an
                amount of my time on Linux system administration and web
                development.<br>
                <br>
                See <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> or feel free to
                browse my <a href="https://github.com/adora0">GitHub</a> to see
                some of my work.
                I am passionate about providing both low and high level backend
                and frontend programming to socialist NGOs in the future.
